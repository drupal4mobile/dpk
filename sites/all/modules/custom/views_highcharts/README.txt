Install instructions:

1. Download and uncompress the latest version of the Highcharts librar into the sites/all/libraries folder. Rename the folder "highcharts" without the version number.
2. Create a view that returns multiple integer or float fields. Adding text fields to the chart will make the chart fail. Please make sure only numeric columns are checked. Eventually there will be a check for this.
